## **Introduction to BlackJack**

**BlackJack**, also know as Twenty One due to the special role of the number in the game, is arguably the oldest known casino game. The game played with 1 to 8 deck of cards allows the player to directly play against the casino and remains **one of the only mathematically beatable casino games.**

A small introduction of the rules can be found on the link: [Intro Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwwaJGStuP0)

As seen a total of 5 actions can be taken by the player:


*   **Hit:** Draws a card
*   **Stand:** No more card to draw
*   **Double:** Doubles the bet and draws one card and stands
*   **Split:** Splits a value pair into two individual hands to play separately
*   **Surrender:** Forfiets the game by splitting the bet amount equally between the Casino and the Player.
